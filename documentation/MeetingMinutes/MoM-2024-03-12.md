### Long term discussions

#### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - [Document uploaded by TEF](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/files/12856149/AdminCode.Proposal.-.Draft_20230926.docx) with a proposal. 

  This item should be reopen after MWC.

  - We should discussed approach on this for next release. Should we incorporate this to current operations, should we split this functionality to new endpoints or even separate APIs?
    - Need to be discussed
      - Ludovic preference is for a separate API as for example in France this is not a request.
      - For Javier this is not a top priority for Telefonica as of now.
    - More generally probably we need to have feedback loop with GSMA team about API work (and review the priority as focus could change)
      - Perhaps a point to be share in TSC.

#### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - As requested by Joachim, issue will remain open until TEF uploads the document with more detail or the information is added to an API_documentation file to keep in the repo for future references.
    - Joachim: Should be also aligned/synchronysed with Geofencing
