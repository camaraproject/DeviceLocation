  title: Device Location Retrieval
  description: |
    This API provides the ability to retrieve a device location.

    # Introduction

    With this API, API consumers can retrieve the area where a certain user device is localized.
    The area provided in the response could be described:
    -  by a circle determined by coordinates (latitude and longitude) and a radius.
    -  by a simple polygon delimited by segments connecting consecutively an array of coordinates (points). The last point connects to the first point to delimit a closed shape bounded with straight sides.

    The retrieved shape depends on the network conditions at the device's location and any of the supported shapes could be received.

    The requester could optionally ask for
     * a freshness of the localization information by providing a `maxAge` ("I want a location not older than 600 seconds").
     * an accuracy of the localization information by providing a `maxSurface` ("I want a location not larger than 1000000 square meters").


    The result accuracy depends on the network's ability and accuracy to locate the device.

    Additionally to location information, the answer will also provide indication about the location time.

    Location retrieval API could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - Fraud protection to ensure a given user is located in the region, country or location authorized for financial transactions
    - Verify the GPS coordinates reported by the app on a device to ensure the GPS was not faked e.g. for content delivery with regional restrictions
    - Contextual-based advertising, to trigger advertising after verifying the device is in the area of interest

    - Smart Mobility (Vehicle/bikes renting): obtain the location of a vehicle/bike to guarantee they are rented correctly

    **Note**: Location is in most jurisdictions considered to be sensitive data and thereby consent by device owner/user must be verified before providing it to the developer.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **Area**: It specifies the geographical surface where a device may be physically located.

    * **Max Age**: Maximum age of the location information which is accepted for the location retrieval (in seconds).

      * Absence of `maxAge` means that "any age" is acceptable for the client. In other words, this is like `maxAge`=infinite. The system will return `lastLocationTime` in the response. If the system is not able to provide location, an error 404 with code LOCATION_RETRIEVAL.DEVICE_NOT_FOUND is sent back.
      * `maxAge`=0 means that a fresh calculation is requested by the client. If the system is not able to provide the fresh location, an error 422 with code LOCATION_RETRIEVAL.UNABLE_TO_FULFILL_MAX_AGE is sent back.

    * **Last Location Time** : Last date and time when the device was localized.

    * **Max Surface**: Maximum surface in square meters which is accepted by the client for the location retrieval.

      * absence of `maxSurface` means that "any surface size" is acceptable for the client.
      * API implementation could specify in the documentation the `maxSurface` minimum acceptable (for exemple minimun of 10000 square meters allowed).
      * If the system is not able to provide an area with a surface acceptable with the client request, an error 422 with code LOCATION_RETRIEVAL.UNABLE_TO_FULFILL_MAX_SURFACE is sent back.
      * Note: if both `maxAge` and `maxSurface` requirements fail, the system can either send back one or the other error code.


    # API Functionality

    The API exposes a single endpoint/operation:

    - `/retrieve` : Retrieve where the device is localized.
     The operation returns:
        * a localization defined either as a circle, with the center specified by the latitude and longitude, and a radius for answer accuracy, or as polygon defined by the array of points delimiting its boundary.
        * a timestamp with the location information freshness.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the API Provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    # Identifying a device from the access token

    This specification defines the `device` object field as optional in API requests, specifically in cases where the API is accessed using a 3-legged access token, and the device can be uniquely identified by the token. This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers by relying on the device information associated with the access token used to invoke the API.

    ## Handling of device information:

    ### Optional device object for 3-legged tokens:

    - When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the access token must be considered as the device for the API request. This means that the device object is not required in the request, and if included it must identify the same device, therefore **it is recommended NOT to include it in these scenarios** to simplify the API usage and avoid additional validations.

    ### Validation mechanism:

    - The server will extract the device identification from the access token, if available.
    - If the API request additionally includes a `device` object when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that the device identifier provided matches the one associated with the access token.
    - If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a 403 - INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT error, indicating that the device information in the request does not match the token.

    ### Error handling for unidentifiable devices:

    - If the `device` object is not included in the request and the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access token, the server will return a 422 `UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE` error.

    ### Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated identifier:

    - For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier associated to the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged access tokens, the `device` object MUST be provided in the API request. This ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API call made with these tokens.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device
        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
