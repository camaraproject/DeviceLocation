## Open issues and PRs


### Geofencing v0.1-wip (Subscription for Location Area) 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - Old PR #49 was close, new PR created
  - Comments addressed, ready for final approval
 
* [Issue #69](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/69): Proposal for new name
  - `geofencing` got consensus as name, PR updated, issue closed


### New API to provide raw location, v0.1-wip

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Reviewed, has 2 approvals. Ready to be merged
  - Ludovic will work on the documentation only once PR#55 has been merged to avoid 


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 

* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate
  - Discussion during meeting. Issue to be updated:
    - Akos commented that the ratio may not be enough and maybe we should add some text or rational.
    - Cetin thinks that it makes sense to return a low percent since it is caused by a bad behaviour of the network. 
    - Telefónica agrees but raise the problem with Product team approach and how the quality of the product is perceived.
    - We will see the possibility to split the partial values into different values as proposed by Jose and Akos.

### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85) to unify naming for POST operations
  - Current one: POST /verifications + POST /retrieve-location
  - Decide on POST /verify-location + POST /retrieve-location, or simpler: POST /verify + POST /retrieve
  - **Agreed to change paths to POST /verify + POST /retrieve**

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.

* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in August featuring 
    - For location-verification: -> ready for 0.2
    - For location: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> ready to be merged - documentation will be tackled in a separate PR
    - For geofencing: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> ready to be merged - documentation will be tackled in a separate PR
  - Release in late August / September (depending on holidays):  


### Postal Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track, closing old [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39). [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47) to be closed when new one is created.

* Some initial comments, we can start discussion but this requirement will be in the scope of future releases.
  - How to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.
  - How to discover what is implemented by each provider.
  - Error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco

* Requirement to be covered by future releases, we keep discussion open in issue.


## Summer 2023 presence

* Decided to skip Aug 15th


## AOB

* Akos raises the Commonalities Issue regarding CloudEvents and how it will affect the Geofencing API. 
  - From Telefónica, another colleague is working on the issue and will update Commonalities in the next days.

**Next call is on August 29th**
