  title: Device location verification API
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to verify the location of a device. 

    # Introduction

    Customers are able to verify whether the location of certain user device is within the area specified. Currently the only area supported is a circle determined by the provided coordinates (latitude and longitude) and some expected accuracy (radius).

    The verification result depends on the network's ability and accuracy to locate the device at the requested area. The network may not be able to locate the device, or the requested area may not match the area where the network locates the device. In this case, the verification result is `UNKNOWN` or `FALSE` respectively. If the network locates the device within the requested area, the verification result is `TRUE`. If the requested area partially match the area where the network locates the device, or the accuracy provided by the network is higher than the requested one, the verification result is `PARTIAL`. In this case, a `match_rate` could be included in the response, indicating an estimation of the likelihood of the match in percent.

    Location Verification could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - Fraud protection to ensure a given user is located in the region, country or location claimed for financial transactions
    - Verify the GPS coordinates reported by the app on a device to ensure the GPS was not faked e.g. for content delivery with regional restrictions
    - Location-based advertising: trigger targeted advertising after verifying the user is in the area of interest
    - Smart Mobility (Vehicle/bikes renting): confirm the location of the device and the location of the vehicle/bike to guarantee they are rented correctly

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **Area**: It specifies the geographical surface where a device may be physically located.

    * **Verification**: Process triggered in the API server to confirm or contradict the expectation assumed by the API client about the device location.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes a single endpoint/operation:

    - Retrieve whether the device location is within a requested area, currently circle with center specified by the latitude and longitude, and radius specified by the accuracy. The operation returns a verification result and, optionally, a match rate estimation for the location verification in percent.

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).
        
        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.
        
        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)
      
        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
