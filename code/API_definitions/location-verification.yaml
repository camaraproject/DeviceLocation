  title: Device Location Verification
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to verify the location of a device.

    # Introduction

    Customers are able to verify whether the location of certain user device is within the area specified. Currently the only area supported as input is a circle determined by the a set of coordinates (latitude and longitude) and some expected accuracy (radius).

    The verification result depends on the network's ability and accuracy to locate the device at the requested area.

    * If the network's estimation of the device's location is fully contained within the requested area, the verification result is `TRUE`.
    * If the network's estimation of the device's location does not overlap with the requested area at all, the verification result is `FALSE`.
    * If the network's estimation of the device's location partially overlaps with the requested area, or it fully contains the requested area (because it is larger), the result is 'PARTIAL'. In this case, a `match_rate` is included in the response, indicating an estimation of the likelihood of the match in percent.
    * Lastly, the network may not be able to locate the device. In this case, the verification result is `UNKNOWN`.

    The client may optionally include a `maxAge` indication. If the location information known to the server is older than the specified `maxAge`, the verification result will be `UNKNOWN` and the `lastLocationTime` attribute may indicate the last available time for the device location.

    `lastLocationTime` will be always included in the response unless there is no historical location information available for the device. In this case, `UNKNOWN` will be returned without `lastLocationTime`.

    Location Verification could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - Fraud protection, to ensure a given user is located in the location area claimed for financial transactions.
    - Verification of GPS coordinates reported by the app on a device, to ensure the GPS was not faked, e.g. for content delivery with regional restrictions.
    - Contextual-based advertising, to trigger advertising after verifying the device is in the area of interest.
    - Smart mobility (vehicle / bikes renting), to confirm the location of the device and the location of the vehicle/bike to guarantee they are rented correctly.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **Area**: It specifies the geographical surface where a device may be physically located.

     * **Max Age**: Maximum age of the location information which is accepted for the location verification (in seconds).
        * Absence of maxAge means "any age" is acceptable for the client. In other words, this is like maxAge=infinite. In this case the system may still return lastLocationTime, if available.
        * maxAge=0 means a fresh calculation is requested by the client. If the system is not able to provide the fresh location, an error 422 with code LOCATION_VERIFICATION.UNABLE_TO_FULFILL_MAX_AGE is sent back.


    * **Verification**: Process triggered in the API server to confirm or contradict the expectation assumed by the API client about the device location.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes a single endpoint/operation:

    - Verify whether the device location is within a requested area, currently a circle with center specified by the latitude and longitude, and radius specified by the accuracy. The operation returns a verification result and, optionally, a match rate estimation for the location verification in percent.

    # Authorization and authentication

    [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md) provides details on how a client requests an access token.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number). In order to be globally unique it has to be formatted in international format, according to E.164 standard, prefixed with '+'.

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
