## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Description | Discussion & Action Points |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12). We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - Waiting for new model for `ueId`/`device` to be consolidated in  [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. Expected for next weeks | - **Keep waiting until proposal is merged in  QoD** |
| Subscription for Location Area | [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #27](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/27)<br> - Some feedback by Orange and Telefónica<br> - Some pending comments: Add DELETE and GET, support for susbcription termination due to consent removal (new event?)<br> - Need alignment & feedback with other API (topic raised in Commonalities) | - Good progress in Commonalities<br> - Not far from the work done in Device location<br><br> - **Wait for outcome in Commonalities** |
| Add `maxAge` | [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34)<br> - Feedback from Telefónica<br> - LastLocationTime makes sense for B2B UB but team agreed that privacy constraint need to be considered <br> - Also proposed as [Issue #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/42), so closed as duplicated | - Wait for clear requirement to complete model<br><br>  - **Call for uses cases from the team, in particular for fresh information** |
| Postal Code Area | [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39)<br> - Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area<br> - No feedback so far |  - Discussion on the model, as other code could be used (like INSEE code in France)<br> - Model could accommodate to have several type of code, but our polymorphic model also allow us to be precise.<br><br> - **Orange will provide information for France based on INSEE code** |
| Provide location | [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40)<br> - Also new [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related<br> - Proposal by Ericsson, feedback by DT and TEF | - Joachim: in our product we combine Device status & Device location.<br> - The use case is interesting. Get more details from Product teams<br> - We agree that is a specific endpoint - discussion about adding it to the current API or have a separate API. Version management should be taken into account.<br><br> - **Ludovic will raise an issue in Commonalities about "multiple endpoint API" vs "multiple API"** |


## AOB

* Question from Shuting about architecture
  - **Should be asked to Commonalities**

* In last meeting, DT mentioned to be currently working on an implementation against the NEF
  - To add implemenation code, we may need a new subproject per provider implementaion (PI)as QoD does.
  - **DT dev on NEF on hold**
<p/>

* In last meeting, Rafal raised the point about release management:
  - 0.1 was released for MWC
  - Right now we working on 0.2
  - We need to have an agreement around all API.
  - Discussion on versioning. Proposal to change version each time we implement new code (each time we merge). DT mentioned that a Governance group is set up also to work on this topic, as right now is up to each sub projects.
  - **We will decide on version update before merging new functionality.**

* **Next call is on April 11th.**
