## What's changed

* Second alpha version of `location-verification` API, v0.2.0, renamed from `location`, with main changes:

    - Input property `ueId` evolved to `device`, following CAMARA guidelines.
    - New input parameter `area`, considering initially circular areas, and deprecating previous `latitude`, `longitude` and `accuracy` properties.
    - New input parameter `maxAge`.
    - Response adds new values `UNKNOWN` and `PARTIAL` for `verificationResult`. It also adds properties `matchRate` and `lastLocationTime`.
    - Security schemas and scopes aligned with commonalities guidelines.
    - Error responses adapted to new commonalities guidelines.
    - Inline documentation within OpenAPI spec. 

* First alpha version of the new API `location-retrieval`, v0.1.0:

    - Initial version already aligned with latest guidelines.
    - Returns 2 possible location areas: `CIRCLE` and `POLYGON`.

* First alpha version of the new API `geofencing`, v0.1.0:

    - Initial version already aligned with latest guidelines.
    - Follows CloudEvents format.

# v0.1.0

**This is the first alpha version of the DeviceLocation API.** 

- API [definition](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/tree/release-v0.1.0/code/API_definitions)
- API [documentation](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/tree/release-v0.1.0/documentation/API_documentation)

## What's changed

* New API `location`, v0.1.0, with a single operation for location verification:
    - Given a device identified by the `ueId` object, a set of coordinates (`latitude` and `longitude`), and the requested `accuracy`, returns a boolean `verificationResult`, verifying if the device is within the circular area delimited by the coordinates and the accuracy radius.
