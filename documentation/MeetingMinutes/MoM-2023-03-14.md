| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12). We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - New error format approved in Commonalities<br> - New model for `UeId` is being discussed in [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. New terms agreed, pending to be submitted to Commonalities | - ~~**@jlurien to create PR to align errors to new error model**~~ [Merged](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/28) <br><br>- Wait until discussions on new model for `UeId` are completed in QualityOnDemand and align with them.<br><br> - **Team OK with the change**|
| Subscription for Location Area | [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #27](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/27)<br> - Some feedback by Orange and Telefónica<br> - Some pending comments: Add DELETE and GET, support for susbcription termination due to consent removal (new event?) | - Valid enhancement from the team<br> - Need alignment & feedback with other API (topic raised in Commonalities)<br><br> - **Keep it open for further discussion** |

| Polymorphic Area | [Issue #26](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/26), [PR #29](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/29)<br> - New polymorphic model proposed. Only current `type =  Circle` added<br> - Prepared for new types |  - Add Elevation? Bring a clear UC and open another issue. Issue is to get the information from the network<br> - New types to be proposed, Telefónica to add Postcode, Orange to add polygon<br><br> - **Team OK with the change**  |

## AOB

* DT is currently working on an implementation against the NEF
  - To add implemenation code, we may need a new subproject per provider implementaion (PI)as QoD does.
<p/>

* Rafal raised the point about release management:
  - 0.1 was released for MWC
  - Right now we working on 0.2
  - We need to have an agreement around all API.
 <p/>

* Joachim Dahlgren asked for device location (not check).

  - Tuan Tran (Broadpeak)  supports the UC
  - This is in the scope of this projet
  - We probably need to have different endpoint, scope, etc…
  - We need an issue to discuss.
  - Sensitive from privacy but very relevant with B2B
<p/>

* Shuting asking about future roadmap on this API as today is only Device Location check
  - Team indicated that the API will evolve in future with new capabilities
<p/>

* **Next call is on March 28th.**
