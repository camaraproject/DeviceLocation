## Open issues and PRs


### Geofencing v0.1-wip (Subscription for Location Area) 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - New model based on CloudEvents are now approved
  - PR to be updated, @DT?


### New: Location retrieval - Allow additional area types in the response

* [Issue #94](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/94)
  - Other possible areas other than circle
  - Discuss which ones make sense: Polygon, Ellipse/EllipsoidArc, Areas including altitude?
  - Some comments on issue:
    - OK to add polygon?
    - Others?

### Roadmap to Release v0.2

* The proposed process for a version is to have a version x.y-wip then x.y-rc and then finally released as x.y. This pattern is used in QoD.

* Align the Device Location API with the security schema as described in Unify specification of `securitySchemes`, `security` and scopes, [Commonalities Issue #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/53), [PR #57](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/57)
  - [PR #95](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/95) for location-verification, changing securitySchemes to openIdConnect. Waiting for resolution in Commonalities and Identity and Consent Management WGs.
    - Some approvals, can we merge?

* Next steps:
  - Then create v0.2-rc for location-verification, updating Changelog and Release notes.
  - Add location-retrieval v0.1.0-wip 
  - Add geofencing v0.1.0-wip, after discussion in Commonalities is closed. 
    - geofencing has to be aligned with CloudEvents 

* Naming of the Release
  - Issue opened in [Commonalities Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/60)
  - Proposal to use date format, such as Release 2023-09, but no agreement so far.
    - EdgeCloud API using v1, v2 ...
    - What name should we choose?

### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate

* No new comments

### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - Old [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47) closed.
  - Javier shared a proposal on this topic.
    - **[Question]** How to map postal code to geolocation/coordinate?
      - depending on the country - could be provided by local regulations
    - Javier will share the proposal in the GIT.

* No new comments or progress since last meeting, **no update or discussion during meeting**. Previous questions/doubts:
  - How to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.
  - How to discover what is implemented by each provider.
  - Error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco.
