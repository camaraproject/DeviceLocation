  title: Device Location Verification
  description: |
    This API provides the consumer with the ability to verify the location of a device.

    # Introduction

    API consumers are able to verify whether the location of certain user device is within the area specified. Currently the only area supported as input is a circle determined by a set of coordinates (latitude and longitude) and some expected accuracy (radius).

    * If the provided area is out of the operator's coverage or it is not supported for any reason, an error `422 LOCATION_VERIFICATION.AREA_NOT_COVERED` will be returned.
    * Legal restrictions regarding privacy, or other regulatory or implementation issues, may force the operator to set restrictions to the provided area, such as setting a minimum value to the accepted radius. In these cases, an error `422 LOCATION_VERIFICATION.INVALID_AREA` will be returned and the error message will refer to the reason of the limitation.

    The verification result depends on the network's ability and accuracy to locate the device at the requested area.

    * If the network's estimation of the device's location is fully contained within the requested area, the verification result is `TRUE`.
    * If the network's estimation of the device's location does not overlap with the requested area at all, the verification result is `FALSE`.
    * If the network's estimation of the device's location partially overlaps with the requested area, or it fully contains the requested area (because it is larger), the result is `PARTIAL`. In this case, a `match_rate` is included in the response, indicating an estimation of the likelihood of the match in percent.
    * Lastly, the network may not be able to locate the device. In this case, the verification result is `UNKNOWN`.
    * The client may optionally include a `maxAge` indication. If the location information known to the server is older than the specified `maxAge` or not known at all, an error with code `422 LOCATION_VERIFICATION.UNABLE_TO_FULFILL_MAX_AGE` is sent back, independently of the verification result.

    * `lastLocationTime` will be always included in a success response unless there is no historical location information available for the device. In this case, `UNKNOWN` will be returned without `lastLocationTime`.

    Location Verification could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - Fraud protection, to ensure a given user is located in the location area claimed for financial transactions.
    - Verification of GPS coordinates reported by the app on a device, to ensure the GPS was not faked, e.g. for content delivery with regional restrictions.
    - Contextual-based advertising, to trigger advertising after verifying the device is in the area of interest.
    - Smart mobility (vehicle / bikes renting), to confirm the location of the device and the location of the vehicle/bike to guarantee they are rented correctly.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.

    * **Area**: It specifies the geographical surface where a device may be physically located.

     * **Max Age**: Maximum age of the location information which is accepted for the location verification (in seconds).
        * Absence of maxAge means "any age" is acceptable for the client. In other words, this is like maxAge=infinite. In this case the system will still return lastLocationTime, if available.
        * maxAge=0 means a fresh calculation is requested by the client. If the system is not able to provide the fresh location, an error with code `422 LOCATION_VERIFICATION.UNABLE_TO_FULFILL_MAX_AGE` is sent back.


    * **Verification**: Process triggered in the API server to confirm or contradict the expectation assumed by the API client about the device location.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes a single endpoint/operation:

    - Verify whether the device location is within a requested area, currently a circle with center specified by the latitude and longitude, and radius specified by the accuracy. The operation returns a verification result and, optionally, a match rate estimation for the location verification in percent.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios, where more than one mobile device is associated with the phone number given as input in the API call (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify the device whose location is to be verified. Check with the API provider what is the expected behaviour when a phone number belonging to a multi-SIM group is used as the device identifier, as the API may response with:

    - an error indicating that that phone number is not supported for this API, or
    - the verification for a single device in the multi-SIM group, if one of the devices is considered linked to the main SIM and this concept is supported by the operator, or
    - a verification value that combines the location verification of all the SIMs associated to the requested phone number.

    Possible solutions to make the scenario more deterministic include:

    - Using preferably the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device.
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port.
    - Check with the API provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device
        NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
